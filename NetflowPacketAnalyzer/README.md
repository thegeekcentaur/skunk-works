## Problem Statement

We want to build a python application with an asyncio event loop. This event loop awaits messages to be sent from a function called "process_flows", and prints them out.
This function is however cpu intensive so it has been decided this function needs to be written to a new language of our choice. So this eventually becomes a python function calling a compiled code which helps off-load the heavy computing/processing.
